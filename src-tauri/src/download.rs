//! Fetching model weights from HuggingFace into the app's data directory.
//!
//! Both local engines' weights are *plain files the app owns*, and both come through here.
//! That distinction used to matter: the MLX engines kept their weights inside a HuggingFace
//! cache that their own Python runtime managed, so they had to be installed *by* that
//! runtime — hand-placing files into a cache layout we do not control is how you get a
//! "downloaded" model that the library then cannot find. That path went with Qwen3-TTS;
//! Chatterbox Multilingual is now an ONNX export the app fetches and verifies itself.
//!
//! Design points, measured rather than assumed:
//!
//! * **Parallel ranges.** A single connection from HuggingFace's CDN moved 0.42 MB/s on
//!   this machine while the multi-connection path reached 5.86 MB/s. On a 325 MB graph
//!   that is the difference between 13 minutes and one, so large files are fetched as a
//!   few range requests written straight into place.
//! * **Pinned revisions.** Files come from an explicit commit, never `main`, so an
//!   upstream change cannot silently alter what gets verified.
//! * **Verified.** HuggingFace reports the content sha256 in `x-linked-etag` for large
//!   files. That claim was checked against a locally cached copy of `voices/af_heart.bin`
//!   and the hashes matched, so it is a real content hash and not merely a server label.
//! * **Nothing partial survives.** A file lands as `<name>.part` and is renamed only once
//!   its hash checks out, so a half-downloaded graph can never look like an installed
//!   engine.
