//! Which engine actually speaks, and what happens when one cannot.
//!
//! The app has three ways to make sound and they share almost nothing:
//!
//! * **Apple system voices** — `/usr/bin/say` on a pipe, text straight in.
//! * **Kokoro** — phonemes from the local front end, an ONNX graph, then PCM samples.
//! * **Chatterbox** — text through its own tokenizer, four ONNX graphs and a kv-cache loop,
//!   with the speaker cloned from a reference clip.
//!
//! Kokoro does not accept text. It accepts phonemes, and the tables that produce them were
//! fetched alongside the graph ([`crate::g2p`]). Chatterbox does accept text — its whole front
//! end is a Llama BPE tokenizer — but it does not accept a *voice*: the speaker is a clip, so
//! what this module hands it is a path.
//!
//! Both local engines use one native PCM output queue per reading. An unavailable engine
//! reports an error instead of changing the chosen voice.
