//! Does a selection actually come out as speech?
//!
//! `install.rs` answers "can the weights be fetched and loaded". `g2p_parity.rs` answers
//! "are the phonemes right". This is the one that answers the question the app exists for:
//! **text in, audio out, through the same code the shortcut calls** — not a copy of it, and
//! not a mock.
//!
//! It is `#[ignore]`d because it needs a real ~346 MB install. Point it at one:
//!
//! ```bash
//! KIEGEN_MODELS_DIR=/some/dir cargo test --test speak -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! The WAV it writes is the artifact worth checking by hand; the transcript of that file is
//! the proof, not these assertions:
//!
//! ```bash
//! whisper-cli -m ~/.cache/whisper/ggml-base.en.bin -otxt <the wav it printed>
//! ```
